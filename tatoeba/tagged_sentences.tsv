courtroom	149	2252256	Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to begin the voir dire.
courtroom	150	2252257	Court's adjourned.
courtroom	151	2252258	Attorneys, both of you, see me in my chambers right now.
courtroom	152	2252259	Do you feel that this lawsuit is frivolous?
courtroom	153	2252261	They were complicit in those murders, and this I'll prove to you during the course of the trial.
courtroom	154	2252264	Here's the deposition you needed.
courtroom	155	2252266	Objection, Your Honor, this is all speculation.
courtroom	156	2273047	Tom is being sued.
courtroom	157	2313099	How do you plan to proceed now? "My client wants to testify." "And say what?" "That he’s innocent."
courtroom	158	2313104	I’ll argue the motion. "They are coming down to watch the motion, they’re hoping you crash in there."
courtroom	159	2313107	If you’ll excuse us, we’re due in court.
courtroom	160	2313108	Objection. This certainly has no relevance. "All objections have been waived till the trial."
courtroom	161	2313109	Are you aware the trial begins tomorrow?
courtroom	162	2313112	At the very least you could get a restraining order.
courtroom	163	2313113	Deposition of Mr. Moon is today. I assume you’ve prepared for today’s deposition.
courtroom	164	2313115	Evidently, our expert witness comes armed not only with details but a conscience.
courtroom	165	2313116	He got a T.R.O.
courtroom	166	2313117	He won the motion and settled the case.
courtroom	167	2313120	He’s ordered a transcript so he can read back to the judge what you said today.
courtroom	168	2313122	I object to that summation; it was entirely too short.
courtroom	169	2313124	I should report you directly to the bar.
courtroom	170	2313125	I’ll review any grounds for appeal.
courtroom	171	2313127	I’m assuming you could speed through your testimony just to keep up with our schedule.
courtroom	172	2313129	I’m fining you $10,000 a day for any further delay.
courtroom	173	2313132	It is also my expert opinion that the document analysis is reliable as these handwriting samples are comparatively similar.
courtroom	174	2313139	It’s a class action involving thousands of plaintiffs, and it’s complicated.
courtroom	175	2313141	It’s the only way you can get a restraining order.
courtroom	176	2313144	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your time.
courtroom	177	2313146	May I have a moment with my client, your honor?
courtroom	178	2313148	Members of the jury, regretfully I must declare this proceeding a mistrial.
courtroom	179	2313151	Motion for continuance denied.
courtroom	180	2313152	Motion for T.R.O. denied.
courtroom	181	2313156	Objection, your honor. There is nothing in the record that even remotely substantiates that.
courtroom	182	2313161	That lawyer is going to pick you apart in open court tomorrow.
courtroom	183	2313164	The accusations are shocking: money laundering, tax evasion and obstruction of justice.
courtroom	184	2313165	The court has to apply a balancing test.
courtroom	185	2313168	The D.A. will be arguing as to reasonable search.
courtroom	186	2313170	The defendant is free to go.
courtroom	187	2313171	The defendant stays in custody.
courtroom	188	2313172	The defense rests, your honor.
courtroom	189	2313176	The district attorney has lodged a complaint against you for witness tampering.
courtroom	190	2313177	The plaintiff lost his motion for sanctions.
courtroom	191	2313179	There’s no proof of anything!
courtroom	192	2313181	The prosecution rests, your honor.
courtroom	193	2313184	The rules of evidence are the same as civil.
courtroom	194	2313186	There’s been no claim for punitive damages, only compensatory.
courtroom	195	2313188	There's no proof of that.
courtroom	196	2313192	This is a class action.
courtroom	197	2313195	This is a deposition. You answer the questions truthfully but never volunteer anything.
courtroom	198	2313198	That was your cross?
courtroom	199	2313202	We have a pretrial conference.
