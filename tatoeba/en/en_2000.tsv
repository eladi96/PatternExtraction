4011393	eng	Tom took an umbrella to school, but Mary didn't.
4011394	eng	Even if I wanted to do that, I couldn't.
4011395	eng	I tried to get Tom to help me, but he wouldn't.
4011414	eng	My hair is longer than Tom's.
4011415	eng	The wallet I found was Tom's.

4011418	eng	Which suitcase is Tom's?
4011419	eng	How long were you at the zoo?
4011420	eng	Tom took his brother to the zoo.
4011421	eng	Tom asked me to take him to the zoo.
4011422	eng	You'd like that now, wouldn't you?
4011423	eng	You'd like to help, wouldn't you?
4011424	eng	You wouldn't really do that, would you?
4011425	eng	Get a chair for Tom, would you?
4011426	eng	Hold onto this for me, would you?
4011427	eng	You'll come back to visit, won't you?
4011428	eng	You'll come back to see us, won't you?
4011429	eng	You'll be nice to Tom, won't you?
4011430	eng	You'll come back to see us sometime, won't you?
4011431	eng	What am I going to do without you?
4011432	eng	How am I going to survive without you?
4011433	eng	How will I manage without you?
4011434	eng	It's not the same around here without you.
4011435	eng	Wouldn't it be better if I went with you?
4011436	eng	Are your parents with you?
4011437	eng	Am I the only one that agrees with you?

4011454	eng	Excuse me, can I have a word with you?
4011455	eng	Tom hasn't been totally honest with you.
4011456	eng	Let me be honest with you.
4011457	eng	Maybe I should go with you.
4011459	eng	Perhaps I might come with you.
4011460	eng	Tom and Mary don't agree with you.
4011461	eng	I'm surprised that Tom didn't agree with you.
4011462	eng	Hand me the hammer, will you?
4011463	eng	Keep an eye on Tom, will you?
4011464	eng	By the way, where were you?
4011465	eng	You weren't supposed to come here, were you?
4011466	eng	What did I say to upset you?

4011486	eng	Why did I ever listen to you?
4011487	eng	Why should we listen to you?
4011488	eng	Does that seem practical to you?
4011489	eng	Why does it matter so much to you?
4011490	eng	Does that mean anything to you?
4011491	eng	Does that make any sense to you?
4011492	eng	What's that smell like to you?
4011493	eng	What's it look like to you?

4011497	eng	What difference does it make to you?
4011498	eng	Why would Tom lie to you?
4011499	eng	Does that look like blood to you?
4011500	eng	When was the last time Tom talked to you?
4011501	eng	No one is threatening you.
4011502	eng	How can we ever thank you?
4011503	eng	Don't forget to say thank you.
4011504	eng	Remember to say thank you.
4011505	eng	Even if I knew where Tom was, I wouldn't tell you.
4011506	eng	Tom told me not to tell you.
4011507	eng	How long will it really take you?
4011508	eng	Why does that surprise you?
4011509	eng	Why should that surprise you?

4011516	eng	What business is that of yours?
4011517	eng	Is that a friend of yours?
4011518	eng	Was Tom a friend of yours?
4011519	eng	Take care of yourselves.
4011520	eng	Do you often talk to yourself?
4011521	eng	How did you support yourself?
4011522	eng	Are you proud of yourself?
4011523	eng	Here, look for yourself.
4011524	eng	Why do you doubt yourself?
4011525	eng	Please control yourself.
4011526	eng	Are you sure you can handle it by yourself?
4011527	eng	Do you really think you can do that by yourself?
4011528	eng	Did you really build that by yourself?
4011529	eng	Do you expect me to believe you did this by yourself?
4011530	eng	Did you really do this all by yourself?
4011531	eng	What are you doing sitting here in the dark all by yourself?
4011532	eng	Are you here all by yourself?
4011533	eng	How can we ever repay you?
4011534	eng	I think Tom will probably remember you.
4011535	eng	What do I have to say to persuade you?

4011550	eng	What time should I meet you?
4011551	eng	Tom said he wants to meet you.
4011552	eng	Everyone's dying to meet you.
4011553	eng	How did you get Tom to marry you?
4011554	eng	Tom obviously loves you.
4011555	eng	My parents are going to love you.
4011556	eng	What makes you so sure Tom likes you?
4011557	eng	Did you get the note that I left you?

4011561	eng	No one's going to hurt you.
4011562	eng	Has Tom ever hit you?
4011563	eng	Are you sure I can't help you?
4011564	eng	Why don't you let us help you?
4011565	eng	Now who's going to help you?
4011566	eng	Do you really think I'm going to help you?
4011567	eng	Isn't there anyone else who can help you?
4011568	eng	Why wouldn't Tom help you?
4011569	eng	What makes you think I'll help you?
4011570	eng	How exactly may I help you?
4011571	eng	No one's going to help you.
4011572	eng	Perhaps I'll be able to help you.
4011573	eng	Maybe I'll be able to help you.
4011574	eng	You've heard about it, haven't you?

4011821	eng	Are you ready to admit you're wrong?
4011822	eng	Do you have any idea what's wrong?
4011823	eng	What made you think that you were wrong?

4011837	eng	This book is very well written.
4011838	eng	This book is well written.
4011839	eng	It's just a superficial wound.
4011840	eng	Tom has been severely wounded.
4011841	eng	Tom was seriously wounded.
4011842	eng	It's taking longer than I thought it would.
4011843	eng	That cost a lot more than I thought it would.
4011844	eng	That took much more time than I thought it would.
4011845	eng	If I could explain it, I would.

4011847	eng	What do you think it's worth?
4011848	eng	What do you think this is worth?
4011849	eng	What do you think my old guitar is worth?

4011853	eng	It could've been a lot worse.
4011854	eng	It certainly could've been worse.

4011864	eng	Are you sure that's going to work?
4011865	eng	How's it supposed to work?
4011866	eng	Well, let's get to work.
4011867	eng	I have to get to work.
4011868	eng	All right, let's get back to work.
4011869	eng	It's time to get back to work.
4011870	eng	How does this thing work?
4011871	eng	There's not a chance that that'll work.
4011872	eng	Do you know where Tom works?
4011873	eng	I've finished all my work.
4011874	eng	How can you be sure it'll work?
4011875	eng	Tom spent all his time working.
4011876	eng	What are the odds of this working?
4011877	eng	Our plan is working.
4011878	eng	Nothing else is working.
4011879	eng	The washing machine still doesn't seem to be working.
4011880	eng	Does Tom ever talk about his work?
4011881	eng	Aren't you supposed to be at work?
4011882	eng	Is everything going OK at work?
4011883	eng	What are you doing after work?
4011884	eng	Does this ever actually work?
4011885	eng	Were those Tom's exact words?
4011886	eng	We got lost in the woods.
4011887	eng	Tom and John both married younger women.
4011888	eng	Do you recognize that woman?

4011891	eng	Is there anything I can help you with?
4011892	eng	Is there anything I could help you with?
4011893	eng	Perhaps that's something I can help you with.
4011894	eng	Maybe that's something I can help you with.
4011895	eng	Who were you on the phone with?

4011902	eng	Who are you spending Christmas with?

4011904	eng	Is there anyone you don't get along with?
4011905	eng	Tom is one of the hardest guys to get along with.
4011906	eng	Are you sure that's wise?
4011907	eng	Do you really think you're going to win?
4011908	eng	What chance does Tom have of actually winning?
4011909	eng	How about a glass of wine?
4011910	eng	Did Tom really drink a glass of wine?
4011911	eng	Tom poured Mary a glass of wine.
4011913	eng	This is a good bottle of wine.

4011915	eng	What's your most expensive wine?
4011916	eng	Tom wants you to help him wash windows.
4011917	eng	Do you really think you can win?
4011918	eng	I heard that Tom has left his wife.
4011919	eng	Someone told me Tom left his wife.
4011920	eng	Tom asked Mary to pretend to be his wife.
4011921	eng	Tom invited us to have dinner with him and his wife.
4011922	eng	It's about three inches wide.
4011923	eng	Is that really the reason why?
4011924	eng	What I don't understand is why.
4011925	eng	Would you mind if I ask why?
4011926	eng	See you in a little while.
4011927	eng	Tom wants you to wait for a while.
4011928	eng	No one's been here in a while.

4011931	eng	It's been quite a while.

4011944	eng	It's not going very well.
4011945	eng	Tom gets paid very well.
4011946	eng	I didn't think Tom could speak French that well.

4011993	eng	We don't have much choice, do we?
4011994	eng	We did have fun together, didn't we?

4012011	eng	It's much easier this way.
4012012	eng	Come on, let's get out of the way.
4012013	eng	Perhaps we can help Tom in some way.

4012143	eng	Why is Tom being so mean to us?
4012144	eng	Why would Tom lie to us?
4012145	eng	Why is Tom being so nice to us?
4012146	eng	Tom is the guy that wanted to talk to us.
4012147	eng	I think Tom was lying to us.
4012148	eng	What's stopping us?
4012149	eng	No one's going to see us.
4012150	eng	Thanks for reminding us.
4012151	eng	How did you get here ahead of us?
4012152	eng	There were about thirty of us.
4012153	eng	There's room for both of us.
4012154	eng	There were only three of us.
4012155	eng	I forgot to tell Tom what time to meet us.
4012156	eng	Would either of you like to join us?
4012157	eng	My friends and I are hanging out tonight. Would you like to join us?
4012158	eng	Would you like to join us?
4012159	eng	Will you and Tom join us?
4012160	eng	Perhaps we should ask Tom to join us.
4012161	eng	I tried to persuade Tom to join us.
4012162	eng	Perhaps you'd like to join us.
4012163	eng	Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
4012164	eng	Would you mind helping us?
4012165	eng	It might've taken longer if Tom hadn't helped us.
4012166	eng	It might make things easier if Tom helped us.
4012167	eng	Are you saying Tom won't help us?
4012168	eng	Do you know of anyone that can help us?
4012169	eng	Do you think Tom can help us?
4012170	eng	Do you really think Tom will help us?
4012171	eng	Why would Tom come over here and help us?
4012172	eng	Tom didn't want to help us.
4012173	eng	There's nobody left to help us.
4012174	eng	I want to get Tom to help us.
4012175	eng	Maybe there's someone else who can help us.
4012176	eng	I didn't think Tom would help us.
4012177	eng	Are you sure Tom can't hear us?
4012178	eng	Do you think anyone is going to hear us?
4012179	eng	Are you sure Tom can hear us?
4012180	eng	Why didn't you wait for us?
4012181	eng	Do you have any questions for us?
4012182	eng	What else can you do for us?
4012183	eng	How long have you been working for us?
4012184	eng	Are they still looking for us?
4012185	eng	Tom said he wouldn't mind waiting for us.
4012186	eng	How did you know where to find us?
4012187	eng	What kind of poison did you use?
4012188	eng	It's relatively simple to use.
4012189	eng	It's simple to use.
4012190	eng	This is the desk that Tom uses.
4012191	eng	These will be very useful.
4012192	eng	This could be very useful.
4012193	eng	Did you find anything that might be useful?
4012194	eng	What good does that do us?
4012195	eng	Please quit bothering us.
4012196	eng	Those guys are looking at us.
4012197	eng	Are you with us or against us?
4012198	eng	How did Tom find out about us?
4012199	eng	My secretary said it was urgent.
4012200	eng	It's really quite urgent.
4012201	eng	It really is quite urgent.
4012202	eng	What time should I pick you up?
4012203	eng	Let me know the moment Tom wakes up.
4012204	eng	What time did Tom say he'd pick us up?
4012205	eng	Why hasn't anybody cleaned this up?
4012206	eng	Thanks for clearing that up.
4012207	eng	I'm sure that Tom made that story up.
4012208	eng	There's a fire upstairs.
4012209	eng	The children were asleep upstairs.
4012210	eng	I heard that Tom and Mary have split up.
4012211	eng	Would the two of you shut up?
4012212	eng	The teacher told Tom to shut up.
4012213	eng	We waited for Tom at the library for thirty minutes, but he never showed up.
4012214	eng	There's no reason to get upset.
4012215	eng	It was too good a deal to pass up.
4012216	eng	Are they going to beat me up?
4012217	eng	What time do you want to pick me up?
4012218	eng	Thank you for waking me up.
4012219	eng	Tom apologized and then hung up.
4012220	eng	Did you know each other growing up?
4012221	eng	Tom and Mary still live in Boston where they both grew up.
4012222	eng	What are you still doing up?
4012223	eng	I hear that Tom and Mary have broken up.
4012224	eng	I think that would be very unwise.
4012225	eng	That would be very unwise.
4012226	eng	Have you noticed anything unusual?
4012227	eng	Aren't you being just a little unreasonable?
4012228	eng	Have you finished unpacking?
4012229	eng	This is completely unnecessary.
4012230	eng	Tom showed up at Mary's house unexpectedly.
4012231	eng	It's very hard to understand.
4012232	eng	Do you still not understand?
4012233	eng	How long has Tom been unconscious?
4012234	eng	This place is unbelievable.
4012235	eng	I see that you've found your umbrella.
4012236	eng	Is that Tom's umbrella?
4012237	eng	Do you still have Tom's umbrella?
4012238	eng	This is Tom's umbrella.
4012239	eng	Tom told Mary to take an umbrella.
4012240	eng	Tom urged Mary to take an umbrella.
4012241	eng	Tom told Mary that she should take an umbrella.
4012242	eng	How are things between you two?
4012243	eng	What's wrong with you two?
4012244	eng	Lightning does sometimes strike the same place twice.
4012245	eng	Do you have a pair of tweezers?
4012246	eng	How much time do you spend watching TV?
4012247	eng	All Tom does is play video games and watch TV.
4012248	eng	Could you please turn off the TV?
4012249	eng	Next time, it's your turn.
4012250	eng	There's no water in the tub.
4012251	eng	What makes you think I wasn't trying?
4012252	eng	Should I consider giving it another try?
4012253	eng	How did you discover the truth?
4012254	eng	Why don't you just tell Tom the truth?
4012255	eng	◊ÅWhy didn't Tom tell the truth?
4012256	eng	What made you believe Tom was telling the truth?
4012257	eng	Are you afraid of the truth?
4012258	eng	I think what Tom told us wasn't the truth.
4012259	eng	There's a blanket in the trunk.
4012260	eng	How long have you been playing the trumpet?
4012261	eng	Are any of those things true?
4012262	eng	Do you actually think that's true?
4012263	eng	How can you be sure that's true?
4012264	eng	Are you saying that's not true?
4012265	eng	We don't even know if it's true.
4012266	eng	That's not entirely true.
4012267	eng	That's not completely true.
4012268	eng	Where did you park the truck?
4012269	eng	Have you been staying out of trouble?
4012270	eng	It seemed like too much trouble.
4012271	eng	Are you looking for trouble?
4012272	eng	Tom has three soccer trophies.
4012273	eng	Did you know Tom plays the trombone?
4012274	eng	Why did you cancel your trip?
4012275	eng	What do you think I should pack for my trip?
4012276	eng	This is going to be a great trip.
4012277	eng	It could be some kind of trick.
4012278	eng	Is this some kind of a trick?
4012279	eng	This isn't an apple tree.
4012280	eng	Tom lost control of his car and crashed it into a tree.
4012281	eng	Have you taken out the trash?
4012282	eng	This better not be a trap.
4012283	eng	That wasn't easy to translate.
4012284	eng	Tom got up early in order to catch the first train.
4012285	eng	It's an old Irish tradition.
4012286	eng	It seemed like a good trade.
4012287	eng	Please give Tom all these toys.
4012288	eng	What brings you back to town?
4012289	eng	When will you get back to town?
4012290	eng	Do you live in this part of town?
4012291	eng	How long are you going to be in town?
4012292	eng	It did take some getting used to.
4012293	eng	What are these kids up to?
4012294	eng	This could be a little tough.
4012295	eng	Which hospital did they take Tom to?
4012296	eng	Do you know the guys Tom is talking to?
4012297	eng	Isn't there someone else you can talk to?
4012298	eng	I only talked to Tom when there was no one else to talk to.
4012299	eng	Are you a doctor now, too?
4012300	eng	Humans aren't the only animals that use tools.
4012301	eng	Do you guys want to come, too?
4012302	eng	Tom was arrested, too.
4012303	eng	Did you enjoy yourself tonight?
4012304	eng	What's wrong with you tonight?
4012305	eng	There's no wind tonight.
4012306	eng	What should I wear tonight?
4012307	eng	Are you going to meet Tom tonight?
4012308	eng	I'll talk with Tom tonight.
4012309	eng	It's not likely Tom will be there tonight.
4012310	eng	Do you have a place to stay tonight?
4012311	eng	What are your plans tonight?
4012312	eng	What are you going to wear to the party tonight?
4012313	eng	Are you going to go to the party tonight?
4012314	eng	I'm invited to Tom's party tonight.
4012315	eng	My boss wants me to work late tonight.
4012316	eng	Could you do me a favor and babysit my kids tonight?
4012317	eng	It'll take me at least three hours to do my homework tonight.
4012318	eng	Are you coming home tonight?
4012319	eng	Are you going to be home tonight?
4012320	eng	Are your parents going to be home tonight?
4012321	eng	Are any of you guys free tonight?
4012322	eng	Did you have plans for tonight?
4012323	eng	Have you had anything to drink tonight?
4012324	eng	What are you guys doing tonight?
4012325	eng	What are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
4012326	eng	Didn't you have a date tonight?
4012327	eng	Are you still planning on going back to Boston tonight?
4012328	eng	Are they coming back tonight?
4012329	eng	Are you coming back tonight?
4012330	eng	Is Tom coming back tonight?
4012331	eng	Tom is babysitting tonight.
